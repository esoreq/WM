\caption{Post-hoc multicomparison tests were perfomred to assess the direction of the domain by load effects. Significantly slower RTs during high compared to low regardless of domain were found. However, the differences was twice as long for number compared to location.\label{tabel:behStudy2RTphloadbydomain}}
