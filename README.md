Decoding working-memory domains and sub-processes from dynamic network states
This code creates the figures and tables for our upcoming paper 
"Dynamic network coding of working-memory domains and working-memory processes"
It relies on an additional liberary that handles ploting and additional integration that 
needs to be downloaded from https://github.com/esoreq/c3nl_fusion [doi 10.5281/zenodo.1186726]
and added to path before it can be used.
